Testing 

Manual Testing : Testing in the browser (after deployment)


Unit Testing: 
	Here, we test the business Logic components

Application:
	UI(Presentation)
	BL (here, all the business logic)
	RESTFul Services (Web API , WCF RESTful , Spring MVC RESTful)


Automation OR End-End Testing 
======================
What we need to follow for Unit Testing:
how to develop application for Unit Testing? 
TDD approach .
	Test Driven Develoment 

What is TDD aproach ?

Here, we must develop an application which can have a separate layer for business logic.
So that, we can load/instantiate that business logic component, and unit test easilly.

To support TDD, we must split the application into 3 components.
	* UI (View)
	* Business Logic (functionality/Controllers)
	* Data Access Logic ( Model/REST)

Here, we can instantiate the business logic(controllers) and unit test at any moment before we consume in the UI.


What is Unit Testing ? 
	It a technique of testing the functions whether they are returning/executing proper output or not.


How to do Unit Testing? 
	To do Unit Testing ,we need a separate layout(component) in the application.

	In case of Core JavaScript, we use JavaScript OOP for testable components.
	Use Constructors(objects) for creating Testable components.

	In case of MVC, we got a controller for creating testable components.

	
how to do? 
	For this furpose, we need to create a test page(test.html).
	In this test page, you instantiate the JavaScript component and test the results.
	Here, we are just deploying only test page. (not whole application).
=============
We got many Unit Testing frameworks for JavaScript.

QUnit 
Mocha 
Jasmine
